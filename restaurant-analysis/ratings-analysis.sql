### 1. Ratings given by customer for restaurants

SELECT   b.consumer_id,
	     a.name,
	     b.overall_rating,
	     b.food_rating,
	     b.service_rating
FROM     restaurants as a JOIN customer_ratings as b USING(restaurant_id)
ORDER BY b.restaurant_id;
	
### 2.  Average ratings of each restaurant including its cuisine type

SELECT   a.name,
	     ROUND(AVG(b.overall_rating),2)as overall_Rating,
	     ROUND(AVG(b.food_rating),2)as food_rating,
	     ROUND(AVG(b.service_rating),2)as service_rating,
	     c.cuisine
FROM     restaurants as a JOIN customer_ratings as b USING(restaurant_id) 
				          JOIN restaurant_cuisines AS c USING(restaurant_id)
GROUP BY 1, 5
ORDER BY 1;

### 3. Creating new columns for sentiment analysis


ALTER TABLE customer_ratings ADD COLUMN overall_senti Varchar(50);
ALTER TABLE customer_ratings ADD COLUMN food_senti Varchar(50);
ALTER TABLE customer_ratings ADD COLUMN service_senti Varchar(50);

### 4. Updating the new columns with the sentiments 

UPDATE customer_ratings
SET overall_sentiment = 
		CASE WHEN overall_rating = 0 then 'Negative'
			 WHEN overall_rating = 1 then 'Neutral'	
			 WHEN overall_rating = 2 then 'Positive'
		  END
WHERE overall_sentiment is null;



UPDATE customer_ratings
SET food_sentiment = 
		CASE WHEN food_rating = 0 then 'Negative'
		     WHEN food_rating = 1 then 'Neutral'	
		     WHEN food_rating = 2 then 'Positive'
		  END
WHERE food_sentiment is null;


UPDATE customer_ratings
SET service_sentiment = 
		CASE WHEN service_rating = 0 then 'Negative'
			 WHEN service_rating = 1 then 'Neutral'	
			 WHEN service_rating = 2 then 'Positive'
		  END
WHERE service_sentiment is null;


SELECT * 
FROM   customer_ratings;

### 5. Conduct a sentimental analysis of total count of customers

CREATE VIEW overall AS
	SELECT   overall_sentiment, COUNT(consumer_id) AS total_customers
	FROM     customer_ratings
	GROUP BY 1;


CREATE VIEW food AS

	GROUP BY 1;


CREATE VIEW service AS 
	SELECT   service_sentiment,
			 count(consumer_id) as total_customers
	FROM 	 customer_ratings
	GROUP BY 1;



SELECT a.overall_sentiment as sentiment,
	   a.total_customers as overall_Rating,
	   b.total_customers as food_Rating,
	   c.total_customers as service_Rating
FROM   overall as a JOIN food as b ON a.overall_sentiment = b.food_sentiment

							 JOIN restaurants as c USING(restaurant_id);

### 7. Count of customers visiting local and outside restaurants


SELECT location_preference,
	   COUNT(*) as total_customers,

	FROM   customer_ratings as a JOIN customer_details as b USING(consumer_id)
		  						 JOIN restaurants as c USING(restaurant_id)
		) as cte
GROUP BY 1;				

### 8. Trend of customers visiting outside restaurants

SELECT customer_id,
	   customer_city,
	   restaurant_city,
	   concat_ws(' - ',customer_city , restaurant_city) as direction,
	   restaurant_name		
FROM 	(

	FROM   customer_ratings as a JOIN customer_details as b USING(consumer_id)
								 JOIN restaurants as c USING(restaurant_id)
		) as cte
WHERE  location_preference = 'Outside';		  

### 9. Count of direction trend from above query

SELECT direction,
	   COUNT(customer_id) as total_customers

FROM  (  
	SELECT customer_id,
		   customer_city,
		   restaurant_city,
		   concat_ws(' - ',customer_city , restaurant_city) as direction,

									 JOIN restaurants as c USING(restaurant_id)
									 
			) as cte
	WHERE  Location_preference = 'Outside' ) cte2
GROUP BY 1;

### 10. Cuisine preferences vs cuisine consumed


SELECT  a.consumer_id,
	    GROUP_CONCAT(b.preferred_cuisine,',') as customer_preferences,
	    d.name,
		c.cuisine as restaurant_cuisine
FROM    customer_ratings as a JOIN customer_preference as b USING(consumer_id)
							  JOIN restaurant_cuisines as c USING(restaurant_id)
							  JOIN restaurants as d USING(restaurant_id)
GROUP BY 1, 3, 4;

### 11. Best restaurants for each cuisines by different ratings

### 12. Worst restaurants for each cuisines by different ratings


CREATE VIEW count_cuisines as

			ORDER BY 5
		) as least;

SELECT   *
FROM     worst
GROUP BY cuisine, worst_overall, worst_for_food, worst_for_service
ORDER BY cuisine

### 13. Total customers with highest ratings in all different criteria
